# CLAUDE.md — PHD

Instruction contract for Claude Code in this repository.

## Mandatory before UI changes

For any UI/React/Next/CSS change, first read:

- `/Users/hector/.openclaw/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/SKILL.md`
- `/Users/hector/.openclaw/skills/web-design-guidelines/SKILL.md`
- `/Users/hector/.openclaw/skills/vercel-composition-patterns/SKILL.md`

Then implement using those rules as a quality checklist (performance, accessibility, composition).

Before finishing, include a short validation note with the critical rules you checked.

## Project-specific skills (recommended)

- `.claude/skills/phd-swiss-design/SKILL.md`
- `.claude/skills/phd-motion/SKILL.md`
- `.claude/skills/phd-section-composer/SKILL.md`

If task is not UI-related, do not load these by default.
